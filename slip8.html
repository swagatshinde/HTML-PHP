//Design an HTML form to accept two strings from the user:a "Large String" and a "Small String". Write a PHP script to perform the following operations:
//Check Occurrence at Start: Determine if the small string appears at the very beginning of the large string (case-insensitive).
//Find Position: Find the first occurrence and the numerical position of the small string within the large string.
Compare First $n$ Characters: Compare both strings to check if they are identical for the first 6 characters (case-insensitive).
